# Open Swarm Network Agent Protocol (OSNAP)

## Architecture

- FastAPI (Implements the Agent API)
  - /info (describes the role of the agent)
  - /tools (describe the tools made available)
  - /run (invoke other agents to perform tasks)
  - /listen (listen for task results distributed to other agents)
  - /finish (agents try and agree they are done)
- Agent (Python/Langchain)
  - Agent State
  - Task Store (Queue, Whatever)
- Tool Store (Redis)
  - Self-Describing Format, with Permissions, Preferences, Restrictions
  - Could be JSON
  - Could be Vectors
  

## Call Sequence

1. My user (agent1) gives the objective
2. Agent1 calls Agent2 /tools endpoint
3. Agent2 sends back tools response from Tool Store
4. Agent1 makes plan (ala babyagi) and asks Agent2 to execute the first step *Can potentially explore more traits and roles here*. This is done via a request to agent2's /run endpoint. Agent2 acknowledges that it recieved the task by responding with some status.
5. Agent1 registers a listener for the task ID.
6. Agent2 does the thing in the background, and when it's done, send a POST request to Agent1s listen endpoint with the result.
7. Continue as long as Agent1 wants to in order to solve the problem. 
8. Agent1 sends a request to the /finish endpoint.
